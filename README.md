# Data science Bootcamp

## What it is
Different tasks i made in a bootcamp. They were written by me and were based on courses, articles and videos about various data science topic, such as NLP, computer vision, deep learning and more.

## What i learned

During the bootcamp, i improved my skills in data processing, information visualization, development and evaluation of machine learning models using various Python libraries. Additionally, i explored advanced concepts such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and deep neural networks, including convolutional networks. 
As my final bootcamp project, I identified a real problem, then created a custom dataset and implemented a complete solution using a machine learning and computer vision pipeline. This experience consolidated my knowledge in data science, and prepared me to face practical challenges and apply machine learning techniques in different contexts.
